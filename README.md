# Jisho Lookup
This is a Firefox extension that uses context menus to simplify looking things up in a Japanese-English dictionary called Jisho.

Functionality:
Whenever you select a piece of text and open up a context menu, an option will be listed with the title: Search Jisho for "[selected text]"

If clicked, it will open up a new tab that searches for the selected text as a keyword on Jisho.org.
